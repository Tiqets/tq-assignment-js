## Things to consider

- The product cards must be responsive. They should adapt to the width of the container.

- The user must be able to go to the product page. What parts should be clickable? Why?
I have made the entire row clickable, we do not have a clear call to action button in the design apart from the row itself.

- Should the product page open in a new page? Why? Why not?
Yes, as we have search results that would lost if we navigated in the same page
