# Tiqets.com Front-end assignment

Thanks for applying! This assignment allows Tiqets.com to assess your skills.

Please fork or clone this repository to start working on it.

## Before you start

To do the assignment you need to have in your system:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) or above (Node 10.X.X at the time of writing)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

This README assumes you have these dependencies already. If you need instructions to install them they should be available in their respective websites.

## The development environment

You can fork or clone this repository to start working and use `yarn` to install the JS dependencies.

    $ git clone https://github.com/tiqets/tq-assignment-js.git
    $ cd tq-assignment-js
    $ yarn

To start the development server, open a terminal and run:

    $ yarn start

A browser window should open with the development environment. Otherwise go to http://localhost:3000. You need to keep this terminal window running for the development server to work.

To run the tests, run:

    $ yarn test

## The assignment

You can find a description of each task in the `tasks/` folder in this repository. The tasks are meant to be completed sequentially.

As you complete the tasks, use `git` as you would use it normally.

We estimate all tasks can be completed in around 2 hours, but you can take as long as you want to finish it.

Try not to use any external dependencies. If you need to do so, please tell us the reasoning behind adding it, and the tradeoffs of doing so

## Submitting the assignment

There are two ways you can send us the complete assignment:

- Make your repo available somewhere. If you want to keep it private in github, add the user [@tiqets-fe](https://github.com/tiqets-fe/) as a collaborator.
- Zip the folder (include the `.git/` folder in the zip) and mail it to us.
